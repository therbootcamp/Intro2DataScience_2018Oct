### Overview

In this practical you'll learn how to work with simple data objects and functions. By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Create vectors of different types using `c()`
2. Understand the three main vector classes numeric, character, and logical using `class()` 
3. Create `data.frames` and `tibbles`! using `data.frame()` and `tibble()`
4. Access vectors from data frames using `$`
5. Calculate basic descriptive statistics using `mean()`, `median()`, `table()` (and more!)

```

# Tasks

## A - Getting setup

1. Open your `baselrbootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`.

2. Open a new R script and save it as a new file called `objects_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Then, load all package(s) listed in the Packages section above with `library()`.

## B - Creating vectors

The table below shows results from a (fictional) survey of 10 Baselers. In this practical, you will convert this table to R objects and then analyse them!

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data <- baselers[1:10, c("id", "sex", "age", "height", "weight")]

data %>% mutate_all(replace_na, " ") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "markdown", caption = "Data from 10 baselers")
```

1. Create a numeric vector called `id` that shows the id values. When you finish, print the vector object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a vector id
XX <- c(XX, XX, ...)

# Print the vector id
XX
```

```{r}
# Create an id vector 
id <- 1:10 # shortcut to creating the sequence from 1 to 10

# Print the vector
id
```

2. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `id` vector. Is it `"numeric"`?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Show the class of an object XX
class(XX)
```

```{r}
# Show the class of the id vector
class(id)
```

3. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `id` vector. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Show the length of the id vector
length(XX)
```

```{r}
# Show the length of the id vector
length(id)
```

4. Create a character vector called `sex` that shows the sex values. Make sure to use quotation marks "" to enclose each element to tell R that the data are of type `"character"`! When you finish, print the object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a character vector sex
XX <- c("XX", "XX", "...")
```

```{r}
# Create a sex vector 
sex <- c("male", "male", "female", "male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "male", "female")

# Print the vector
sex
```

5. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `sex` vector. Is it  `"character"`?

```{r}
# Show the class of the sex vector
class(sex)
```

6. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `sex` object. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

```{r}
# Show the length of the sex vector
length(sex)
```

7. Using the same steps as before, create a `age` and `height` vector.

```{r}
# Create a age vector 
age <- c(44, 65, 31, 27, 24, 63, 71, 41, 43, 31)

# Print the age vector
age

# Show the class of the age vector
class(age)

# Show the length of the age vector
length(age)

# Create a height vector 
height <- c(174.3, 180.3, 168.3, 209, 176.7, 186.6, 151.6, 155.7, 176.1, 166.1)

# Print the height vector
height

# Show the class of the height vector
class(height)

# Show the length of the height vector
length(height)
```

8. Look at the weight data, you'll notice it contains an missing value. Create a vector called `weight` containing these data, following the same steps as before, making sure to specify the missing value as `NA` (no quotation marks). 

```{r}
# Create a weight vector 
weight <- c(113.4, 75.2, 55.5, 93.8, NA, 67.4, 83.3, 67.8, 69.3, 66.3)

# Print the weight vector
weight

# Show the class of the weight vector
class(weight)

# Show the length of the weight vector
length(weight)
```

## C - Functions

1. Using the `table()` function, find out how many males and females are in the data. You should find `r sum(data$sex == "male")` males and `r sum(data$sex == "female")` females!

```{r}
# Count types in sex
table(sex)
```

2. Using the `mean()` function, calculate the mean `age`. It should be `r mean(data$age)`!

```{r}
# Compute mean of age
mean(age)
```

3. Try calculating the mean value of `sex`. What happens? Why?

```{r}
# Compute mean of sex
mean(sex)
```

4. Try calculating the mean `weight`. You should get an `NA` value. Why?

```{r}
# Compute mean of sex
mean(weight)
```

5. Look at the help menu for the `mean()` function (using `?mean`) to look for an argument that will help you with your problem.

```{r}
# Inspect help for mean
?mean
```

6. Using the correct argument for the mean function, calculate the mean weight ignoring `NA` values. It should be `r round(mean(data$weight, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`!

```{r}
# Compute mean weight, ignoring NAs 
mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## D - Logical Vectors

1. Logical vectors contain only `TRUE` and `FALSE` values (and missing values). Create a new vector called `tall_180` indicating which Baselers are taller than 180cm. To do this, use the `>` (greater than) operator รก la `vector > value`.  

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a logical vector tall_180 indicating
#  which baselers are taller than 180cm

XX <- XX > XX
```

```{r}
# Create a logical vector tall_180
tall_180 <- height > 180
```

2. Print your `tall_180` vector to the console. Do you see only TRUE and FALSE values? If so, do the values that are TRUE match the ten Baselers that are actually over 180cm?

```{r}
# print tall
tall_180
```

3. Using the `table()` function, create a table showing how many of the ten Baselers are taller than 180cm and how many are not

```{r}
# count baselers taller than 180
table(tall_180)
```

4. Using the `mean()` function, determine the percentage of the ten Baselers that are taller than 180cm, i.e., `mean(tall_180)`. Should this have worked?

```{r}
# percentage of baselers taller than 180
mean(tall_180)
```

5. What percent of the ten Baselers were older than 30?

```{r}
# percentage of baselers older than 30
mean(age > 30)
```

## E - Creating data frames

1. Using the `data.frame()` function, create a data frame called `ten_df` that contains each of vectors you just created: `id`, `age`, `sex`, `height`, `weight`, `tall_180`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create data frame ten_df containing vectors id, age, sex, height, weight, and tall_180
XX <- data.frame(XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX) 
```

```{r}
# Create ten_df data frame from vectors
ten_df <- data.frame(id, age, sex, height, weight, tall_180) 
```

2. Print your `ten_df` object to see how it looks! Does it contain all of the vectors?

```{r}
# Print ten_df
ten_df
```

3. Using the `dim()` function, print the number of rows and columns in your data frame. Do you get 10 rows and 5 columns?

```{r}
# Inspect dimensions
dim(ten_df)
```

4. What is the class of your `ten_df` object? Use the `class()` function to find out!

```{r}
# Inspect class
class(ten_df)
```

5. Use the `summary()` function to print descriptive statistics from each column of `ten_df`

```{r}
# Inspect class
summary(ten_df)
```

6. Using the `$` operator, print the `age` column from the `ten_df` data frame.

```{r}
# Inspect age
ten_df$age
```

7. Calculate the maximum `age` value from the `ten_df` data frame using `max()`. Do you get the same result from when you calculated it from the original vector `age`?

```{r}
# Get max
max(ten_df$age)
```

8. Instead of creating a data frame of the data using the `data.frame()` function, try creating a tibble called `ten_tibble` using the `tibble()` function. `tibble`s are a more modern, leaner variant of data frame that we prefer over classic `data.frame`s You can use the exact same arguments you used before.

```{r}
# create tibble
ten_tibble = tibble(id, sex, height, weight, tall_180)
```

9. Print your new `ten_tibble` object, how does it look different from `ten_df`? Try calculating the maximum `age` from this object. Is it different from what you got before?

```{r}
# print tibble
ten_tibble
max(ten_tibble$age) == max(ten_df$age)
```

## X - Challenges

1. If you take the `sum()` of a logical vector, R will return the number of cases that are `TRUE`. Using this, find out how many of the ten Baselers are male while using the is-equal-to operator `==`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Determine the frequency of a case in a vector
sum(XX == XX)
```

```{r}
# Determine the frequency of a case in a vector
sum(ten_tibble == "male")
```

2. You can use logical vectors to select rows from a data frame based on certain criteria. using the following template, get the id values of Baselers who are younger than 30:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a logical vector indicating which baselers are younger than 30
young_30 <- XX$XX < 30

# Print the ids of baselers younger than 30
XX$XX[young_30]
```

```{r}
# Create a logical vector indicating which baselers are younger than 30
young_30 <- ten_tibble$age < 30

# Print the ids of baselers younger than 30
ten_tibble$id[young_30]
```

3. Use a combination of logical vectors and the `mean()` function to answer the question: "What is the mean age of Baselers who are heavier than 80kg?"

```{r}
# Mean age of baselers heavier than 80kg
mean(ten_tibble$age[ten_tibble$weight > 80])
```

4. What are the id values of Baselers who are male *and* are shorter than 165cm? (Hint: You will need to use the logical AND operator `&` to combine multiple logical vectors)

```{r}
# Mean age of baselers heavier than 80kg
ten_tibble$id[ten_tibble$sex == "male" & ten_tibble$height < 165]
```
