```{r, include = FALSE}
# INCLUDE ALL OF THIS CODE IN YOUR FIRST CHUNK!

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6,        # Figure width (in)
                      fig.height = 4,       # Figure height (in)
                      echo = FALSE,          # Repeat code

# Load libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(skimr)

# Load data 

mcdonalds <- read_csv("1_Data/mcdonalds.csv")
happiness <- read_csv("1_Data/happiness.csv")
```

In this practical, I will analyse two datasets and show reproducible results in a dynamic document created in R Markdown. R Markdown is great because I can integrate `code` directly into my document, and easily use *italics* and **bold** using formatting tags.

# Fast Food Nutrition 

## {.tabset}

### Overview

```{r, out.width = "30%", fig.cap="Source: Wikipedia"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Cheeseburger.jpg/2560px-Cheeseburger.jpg")
```

The `mcdonalds` data contains `r ncol(mcdonalds)` pieces of information for `r nrow(mcdonalds)` menu items. The data originally come from [https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts](https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts).


### Data

Here is a table showing the first 6 columns in the data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(mcdonalds %>% select(1:6))
```

### Calories Histogram

Across all items, the mean number of calories is `r mean(mcdonalds$Calories)` and the maximum is `r max(mcdonalds$Calories)`. The following plot is a histogram showing the distribution of calories across all menu items

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = Calories)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Calories and Sodium Scatterplot

Is there a relationship between the number of calories and sodium in mcdonalds items? To answer this, let's start by showing a scatterplot:

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = Calories, y = Sodium)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Calories by Category

Which menu categories have the most calories? To answer this, we'll start by creating a barplot showing the the mean calories for each menu category

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 4, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds,
       aes(x = Category, y = Calories, fill = Category)) +
  stat_summary(geom = "bar", fun.y = "mean") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "McDonalds Menu Items",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle.com") +
  theme_bw()
```

Here is a table showing summary statistics of each category

```{r}
Calories_agg <- mcdonalds %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = min(Calories),
    Mean = mean(Calories),
    Median = median(Calories),
    Max = max(Calories)
  )

kable(x = Calories_agg, 
      caption = "Summary Statistics of McDonalds Menu item Calories")
```


### Regression

To see if there is a relationship between calories and sodium across menu items, I conducted a regression analysis using the `lm()` function in R, here are the main results:

```{r}
# Create regression model predicting Sodium from Calories

cal_sod_lm <- lm(Sodium ~ Calories,
                 data = mcdonalds)

# Export cal_sod_lm to a nicely formatted table

kable(x = tidy(cal_sod_lm), 
      digits = 3, 
      caption = "Regression analysis predicting Sodium from Calories")
```


# Happiness

## {.tabset}


### Overview

```{r, out.width = "30%", fig.cap="Source: http://www.miratelinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10-happiest-countries-2015.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.miratelinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10-happiest-countries-2015.jpg")
```

The `happiness` data contains `r ncol(happiness)` pieces of information for `r nrow(happiness)` countries. The data originally come from the World Happiness Report but were taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). 


### Data

Here is a table showing a few columns from the data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(happiness %>% select(Country, Happiness.Rank, Happiness.Score, Generosity))
```

### Happiness histogram

The mean happiness score across all countries is `r mean(happiness$Happiness.Score)`. The following plot is a histogram showing the distribution of Happiness scores across all menu items

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = happiness,
       aes(x = Happiness.Score)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "World Health Report Happiness",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: World Health Report") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Freedom Happiness Scatterplot

What is the relationship between freedom and happiness? To answer this, I started by creating a scatterplot with a point for each country:

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = happiness,
       aes(x = Freedom, 
           y = Happiness.Score, 
           col = Health..Life.Expectancy.,
           size = Health..Life.Expectancy.)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Freedom and Happiness",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot2",
       caption = "Source: World Health Report") +
  guides(size = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
# Create regression model predicting Happiness.Score from Freedom

hap_lm <- lm(Happiness.Score ~ Freedom + Health..Life.Expectancy.,
                 data = happiness)
```


### Regression

I then conducted a regression analysis using the `lm()` function in R, here are the main results:

```{r}
# Export cal_sod_lm to a nicely formatted table

kable(x = tidy(hap_lm), 
      digits = 3, 
      caption = "Regression analysis predicting Happiness from Freedom")
```
